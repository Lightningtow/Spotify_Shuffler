# Spotify Shuffler
When you listen to Spotify with shuffle play enabled, it's not actually random.  
Spotify plays you songs in an order it thinks you'd like to hear. Unfortunately, this algorithm is not very good,
and it ends up just playing you the same 20 songs over and over again.

The way around this is to shuffle the playlist manually, and then listen through the playlist with shuffle disabled.

## Instructions  

1) Grant spotify_shuffler permissions to access your account.
